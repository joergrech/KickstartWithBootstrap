== Introduction ==

Kickstart is a plugin for Grails in order to start your project with a good looking frontend. It is intended to be used in rapid application scenarios such as a Startup Weekend or a prototyping session with a customer.
This plugin provides the following feature:
* Adapted scaffolding templates for standard CRUD pages using the Bootstrap web page template by Twitter.
* Initial set of webpages to describe the website (e.g., about.gsp, contact.gsp, and systeminfo.gsp)
* A language picker that adapts to the available property files in the i18n directory. Using the FamFamFam flag icons.
* A minimal console logging filter (KickstartFilter.groovy) to help understand which actions are called and params are transmitted

| Kickstart uses Bootstrap to render web pages. Bootstrap is made by Mark Otto (@mdo) and Billy Gates (@fat). Bootstrap is designed to help people of all skill levels as a complete kit or to start something more complex.
| Bootstrap is tested and supported in major modern browsers like Chrome 14, Safari 5+, Opera 11, Internet Explorer 7, and Firefox 5.
| Bootstrap is based on elements of HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript 1.8, and jQuery 1.7 with progressively enhanced components to enable a responsive design of the website. Kickstart is built using Groovy 2.0 and Java 7 integrated into the Grails 2.1 framework.

== Usage ==
After installation you must call the kickstart script '''"grails kickstart"''', which will copy several files into your project. 

<pre style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 3px; background-color: #F8F8F8;">

  grails kickstart

</pre>

Afterwards create your domain classes (or copy them into the project) and generate controllers and views - they will
now use the Bootstrap framework!

== Consequences! ==
The Kickstart script will (after asking you) overwrite a few files in the conf, src, and views directories of your project - '''you should use it only on fresh new Grails projects'''. 

Affected files and directories (as of version 0.8.0; see script/Kickstart.groovy for current procedure):
* conf/UrlMappings.groovy
* conf/Config.groovy (will only get one line appended)
* src/templates
* /views/_common (contains common GSP entries such as buttons or modals)
* /views/_errors (contains error GSP for 404, 500, etc.)
* /views/_menu   (contains menus or submenus)
* /views/home    (contains the index.gsp)
* /views/layouts (contains layout files)
* /views/siteinfo (contains separated or static pages such as about.gsp)
* /views/index.gsp will be '''deleted'''!
* /views/error.gsp will be '''deleted'''!

== Configuration ==
Since version 0.9 two config variables are available and can be set in Config.groovy:
* '''kickstart.build.calculate''' can be used to disable the calculation of build numbers and defaults to '''true''' 	
* '''kickstart.metrics.calculate''' can be used to disable the calculation of metrics and defaults to '''true''' 

Furthermore, the views can be configured using the following settings / variables, which have to be defined in the <head> section with the scope "request". An exemplary use of this can be found in the file login/auth.gsp.

Currently, the following settings for the views are supported:
* '''layout_nomainmenu''' to remove the main menu (e.g., containing "Home") in the file "_content_grid.gsp"
* '''layout_nosecondarymenu''' to remove the secondary menu (e.g., containing "List") in the file "_content_grid.gsp"
* '''layout_noflashmessage''' to hide the general presentation of the flash message in the file "_content_grid.gsp"

Similarily, the footer and header can be overwritten (or removed) using sitemesh's pageProperties
* '''page.header''' to define the header by inserting <content tag="page.header'>...</content> in the view (gsp)
* '''page.footer''' to define the footer by inserting <content tag="page.footer'>...</content> in the view (gsp)

== Developer Notes ==
Please note that the '''datepicker''' can handle dates after the year 9999 while most databases (e.g., mysql) handle dates with 4-number years. This might result in date that cannot be stored (such as "01/02/20135") and in Exceptions such as "MysqlDataTruncation: Data truncation: Incorrect datetime value: '20135-02-01 00:00:00'" (@see issue #31). If you want to change this behaviour please have a look in the file "src/groovy/CustomDateEditorRegistrar.groovy" and set lenient to false (However, this will also invalidate years before 1000)
